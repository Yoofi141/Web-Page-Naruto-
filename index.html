   <h1>Why Naruto is my favourite Anime ever made</h1>
   <h2>A childhood memory</h2>
   <h3>Naruto</h3>
   <p>
     <i>Naruto</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto"target="_blank"> is the main character of this anime</a>, the thing that makes him
     such a great character is his growth during the years and his sad
     journey for almost two decades is what makes him such a great main character.
     During the first part of his series his main go was that he wanted to prove his classmates
     wrong as the narrative during beginning was that he was untalented and had
     no skill plus being the class clown didn't really help matters.d
   </p>
   <h3>Sasuke</h3>
   <p>
     <i>Sasuke</i> you could say is the secondary main character of the story and sort
     of acts as Naruto's rival, they are both quite simialr as Sasuke's backstory
     is kind of the same as Naruto's. they work great as a pair as they both
     begin to hate each other but want to become stronger so there are times in
     the show were you see a bit of a competitive nature.
   </p>
   <h3>What makes it great</h3>
   <p>
     Well with movies and tv shows everyone tends to interpret them in different ways which
     is fair. For me this was the first anime I grew up watching with my brother and he was
     the one who suggested that i watched it in japanese with english subtitle, with Naruto
     and Sasuke from the very beginning of the show you already have an idea that they both
     have similar goals. What makes it interesting is that they both have very different
     approaches to their equal goals which is <i>to become stronger and respected among everyone</i>.
     As the show goes on they are more seen as a <strong>Yin/Yang</strong> which makes it
     interesting as it is seen as Sasuke being the Yin (dark side) and Naruto being the Yang
     (light side). About 15 episodes into the first season you already have an idea of how
     it is going to end, big showdown between the two main characters as they have both seemed
     to have leveled up since the first few episodes but its more about on the journey rather than
     destination. There is no doubt that this anime has had a cultural impact since it's release,
     from pop cultural references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Area_51#Facebook_event_and_Internet_meme"target="-_blank">people attempting to go to Area 51 to storm the site</a>.
